This pilot has a focus on the analysis of time series of data, both EO-data from EU satellite missions (The Copernicus contributing mission [Proba-V](https://proba-v.vgt.vito.be/en) as time series spanning multiple years and Copernicus [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) as a time series over a growing season), and in-situ measurements related to agronomy and meteorology.

## Description of the pilot (long)
[http://nextgeoss.eu/pilots/agricultural-monitoring/](http://nextgeoss.eu/pilots/agricultural-monitoring/)

## Application accessible by web browser

### 1.) Time Series Viewer

The Time Series Viewer from the VITO hosted [Proba-V Mission Exploitation Platform (MEP)](https://proba-v-mep.esa.int) is further developed to support as well Sentinel-2 data and derived vegetation products as produced in NextGEOSS pilot ‘Food Security’.

The Proba-V based Time Series Viewer is accessible as [https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/applications/time-series-viewer/app/app.html](https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/applications/time-series-viewer/app/app.html), however this is not giving access to the Sentinel-2 derived vegetation products. For a Web UI on this interface, please refer to the NextGEOSS pilot on Food Security. For Copernicus Global Land products, the Time Series Viewer is accessible at http://viewer.globalland.vgt.vito.be/tsviewer/.

### 2.) Agro STAC Viewer Spatial Temporal Attribute Catalogue for Agronomy

A prototype of this viewer, to visualise and explore time series of in-situ data, is developed in the EC SIGMA project and further refined and enriched with more data in NextGEOSS: [http://agrostac.vgt.vito.be/stac.html](http://agrostac.vgt.vito.be/stac.html)

### 3.) WMTS

Proba-V data ([https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/applications/geo-viewer/app/]([https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/applications/geo-viewer/app/])), Copernicus Global Land Service ([http://viewer.globalland.vgt.vito.be/viewer/](http://viewer.globalland.vgt.vito.be/viewer/)), Sentinel-2 derived vegetation products (added in NextGEOSS - https://sentineldata.vito.be/viewer/[https://sentineldata.vito.be/viewer/]()): these WMTS services are used as well in the NextGEOSS Pilot on Food Security.

## Applications Accessible for Programmers (Interfaces and Documentation)

### 1.) OpenSearch

Web service for discovery of EO-data and derived products produced at and provided by VITO: [http://www.vito-eodata.be/openSearch/description.xml](http://www.vito-eodata.be/openSearch/description.xml). An explanation of this discovery Web Services is provided at [https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/documentation/manuals/opensearch-interface](http://www.vito-eodata.be/openSearch/description.xml).

### 2.) WMTS

Proba-V and Copernicus Global Land ([https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/applications/geo-viewer/app/mapcache/wmts?service=WMTS&request=GetCapabilities](http://www.vito-eodata.be/openSearch/description.xml)), Sentinel-2 ([https://sentineldata.vito.be/wmts?service=WMTS&request=GetCapabilities](http://www.vito-eodata.be/openSearch/description.xml)).

### 3.) Time Series Viewer

Proba-V and Copernicus Global Land ([https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/api/timeseries/apidocs/](https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/api/timeseries/apidocs/)) and Sentinel-2 ([https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/sentinel-web-services](https://proba-v-mep.esa.int/sentinel-web-services), see at the end at section ‘Aggregated time series query’).
